      The Old Windsor Rifle & Pistol club actively encourages young people to participate in the shooting sports.
    </p>
    <p>
      The club holds Guest Days, where members of Home Office approved organisations such as cubs, scouts, guides, cadets and schools can try their hand at target shooting under expert supervision and in complete safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      All ages are catered for. The Old Windsor Cubs are regular visitors on Saturday mornings and Action4Youth have taken advantage of our facilities during their action day.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are involved in running a youth organisation and would like the opportunity to introduce your members to a sport that encourages a healthy attitude to safety, discipline, and responsibility while improving confidence and concentration then please contact us to learn more about what we can offer.

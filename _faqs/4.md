question: Is shooting an expensive hobby?
---
That depends! Like many hobbies you can spend as much or as little as you like, but it all depends on what you shoot, where you shoot and how often. Here's a really rough guide that should help you get an idea about some of the costs involved:

**Basic Setup**
- Training & Licensing: £400-£500
- A safe for your gun(s): £200-£400
- Ear and eye protection: £100
- Other accessories: £100

**Your first firearm**

This is a much harder one to answer, as the price of firearms and shotguns varies from a few hundred pounds up to tens of thousands. Most members start with something in the £500-£1,000 price range, and build up from there. Of course if you purchase multiple firearms and shotguns for different purposes and disciplines the overall cost will increase. You can also find some good deals on second hand guns.

**Ongoing Costs**
- Indoor Range Fee: £5 per session
- Outdoor Range Fee: £20-£30 per session
- Ammo:
  - Small Bore ammo (.22LR): approx. £7-£10 per 100 rounds
  - Full Bore ammo (.223, .308, etc): approx. £90-£150 per 100 rounds

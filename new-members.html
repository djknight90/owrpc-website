  <span class="fe fe-info mr-3"></span>Please read the following carefully before submitting an enquiry for new membership.
</div>

<p>We are currently open to new members. Submitting this form starts your enquiry. If appropriate, you'll be invited to book a short phone call with the Club Secretary. Following that, suitable candidates will be offered an in-person meeting at the club. If successful, youâ€™ll be invited to formally apply for a probationary membership.</p>

<p>All probationary memberships include a structured training programme and must, by law, last a minimum of three months. Full details will be explained at the interview stage.</p>

<p>If you need to contact us for another matter, <a href="/contact-us">please contact us via this page.</a></p>

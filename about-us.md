The Old Windsor Rifle & Pistol Club (OWRPC) was formed in 1977 and provides its members with some of the best facilities available. We have a soundproofed 25 metre indoor range with electronic targets which is open five evenings a week and approved for the following disciplines:

* .22 Prone
* Gallery Rifle (.22 semi auto and pistol calibre)
* Long barrelled revolver
* Black powder rifle & pistol
* Air rifle & pistol
* Practical Shotgun
* Mini Rifle

Our fullbore enthusiasts meet every month on MoD ranges at Ash in Surrey, Longmoor in Hampshire and Otmoor in Oxfordshire. General shoots allow members to test their rifles and make adjustments at distances of 100 to 600 yards. Other activities include Electric Target Range (ETR), McQueen (precision snap shooting) and a variety of club competitions.

We are a friendly club and welcome new members of all abilities. The only requirements are that you are a responsible person with a genuine interest in shooting sports.

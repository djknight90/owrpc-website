<!--Welcome to Old Windsor Rifle & Pistol Club. If you live in the area and are interested in any form of target shooting then you have come to the right place. Have a look around and get in touch if youâ€™d like to join us.

Target shooting is a long-established sport which can be enjoyed by people of all ages and physical ability. Some shooters are highly competitive while others participate for fun and relaxation. There is a wide range of disciplines to suit all interests and budgets, and shooting has one of the best safety records of any sport.-->

Members of the Old Windsor Rifle and Pistol Club are greatly saddened to hear of the death of our Sovereign, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.  As the longest serving British Monarch in history, Her Majesty's unquestioning duty and dedication to the Nation, to the Commonwealth and to Her Armed Forces, charities and organisations will be deeply and profoundly missed.

Her Majesty's interest in, and engagement with all aspects of our sport was widely captured throughout her reign and has been of the greatest importance.  As the Nation and the World mourns, our thoughts are with His Majesty The King and all members of the Royal Family; I know that I speak on behalf of all current and past members of Old Windsor Rifle and Pistol Club, many of which have and still serve in HM Armed Forces in offering our deepest and most heartfelt condolences at this difficult time.

<p class="text-center">GOD SAVE THE KING</p>
